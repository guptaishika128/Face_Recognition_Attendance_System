# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System

The objective of this project is to process live video-stream of students entering their classroom and generate the list of students attending the class. The system is coded in Python using OpenCv , Tkinter and Numpy libraries.
This project has been developed as a part of the Microsoft Engage 2022 program.
