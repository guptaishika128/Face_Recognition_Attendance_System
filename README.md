# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System

The objective of this project is to process live video-stream of students entering their classroom and generate the list of students attending the class. The system is coded in Python using OpenCv , Tkinter and MySQL.
This project has been developed as a part of the Microsoft Engage 2022 program.

- Now run **login.py** 


## ⚙️ HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS?

This system works accordingly with a series of step explained below:

1. **LOGIN PAGE**:

First the admin will login using either default credentials **username=user@123** and **password=user@123** or can create a new account.
